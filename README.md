Hackbio Team (Genomics_2a) decided to replicate a tutorial on the 'Identification of Somatic and Germline Variants from Tumor and Normal Sample pairs' using Galaxy or Linux workflows. Members of the team would be working on different steps in NGS Bioinformatic pipeline (from Raw data processing to Variant annotation). This documentation is focused on read mapping.
